## HOAS rent data scraping / analysis

This repo includes a python file to scrape some information on all of the apartments HOAS provides.
It also has a written report with my conclusions as well as a notebook that I used to generate the plots for the report.

# Dataset
The dataset is under with_grade.csv and running hoas_data_yoinker.py generates a new version of the dataset if new apts have been added
